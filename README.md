Epicycloids and Hypocycloids project

This project was inspired by the Spiral Challenge I was given during my coding bootcamp. I did this project in class in my spare time and never even turned it in as it wasn't an assignment. I just wanted to see if I could accomplish it. 

As with the spiral project, and all my projects that were created during my coding bootcamp - I did not have internet access to look anything up.
