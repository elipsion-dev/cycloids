Epicycloids and Hypocycloids project

This project was inspired by the Spiral Challenge I was given during my coding bootcamp - one of the engineers challenged my class and asked us if any of us could write a web app which could draw a spiral in the web browser without using the canvas. I completed that project - taking it several steps further and making my app draw double, triple, and crazy spirals, as well as random spirals. 

That project gave me an idea - I wonder if I could draw more complex shapes in the same manner. I challenged myself to draw Epicycloids and Hypocycloids in the web browswer, without canvas, and to design an app that would let the user adjust the math to get varying shapes. I did this project in class in my spare time and never even turned it in as it wasn't an assignment. I just wanted to see if I could accomplish it. 

As with the spiral project, and all my projects that were created during my coding bootcamp - I did not have internet access to look anything up.
